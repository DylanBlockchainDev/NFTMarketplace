# NFT-MarketPlace

Welcome to the NFTMarketplace project! This platform is designed to provide a simple yet powerful marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) where you can list, buy and sell NFTs using the Solidity programming language and the Foundry framework for the backend. The core of our project is the NFTMarketplace.sol smart contract, which is accompanied by comprehensive unit and fuzz testing files, as well as deployment scripts to ensure reliability and security.

# Features

Smart Contract: The NFTMarketplace.sol smart contract is the heart of our marketplace, providing the necessary functionality for buying, selling, and managing NFTs.

Testing: We've included both unit and fuzz testing files to ensure the reliability and security of our smart contract.

Deployment: Scripts for deploying the smart contract on the Sepolia test network are provided, allowing for easy testing and development.

Frontend: The user interface is built with React, utilizing JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a simple experience for users to interact with the smart contract.

To explore the smart contract on the Sepolia test network, you can visit the following contract address: '0x9820E251926ca0797021CC85d0b044460Bc9F655', or you can use this link "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9820E251926ca0797021CC85d0b044460Bc9F655".

Disclaimer: I humbly acknowledge that this project is the creation of a learning and aspiring junior blockchain, solidity, web3 developer. I have invested my best efforts, but I cannot guarantee with absolute certainty that everything is error-free and completely secure, despite thorough testing. Therefore, if anyone chooses to utilize this project, it is essential to be well-informed about the actions taken. Moreover, I welcome any constructive feedback, suggestions, or insights from others who may wish to make improvements or highlight potential issues. Your contribution is not only welcome but deeply appreciated.
